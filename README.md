# rladies-nyc-20190523

My slides from my talk at R-Ladies NYC meetup, 2019-05-23. I apologize that out of context some of them may be confusing, but I didn't write speaker notes/a script for this talk. 

Get ahold of me on twitter (@kaelen_medeiros) with questions.

Sincerest apologies to the ACS and SAS (you'll see).
